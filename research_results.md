I'll create a tracked todo list for this research task, then scan the repository for the key template, base, and static files so I can analyze patterns and produce the guide. Expect: a todo list created and file listings/read of representative template files.

Created 5 todos

Why: gather file listings so I can analyze template structure and find representative files (what I'll run: file searches for templates, base_templates, and static; expected outcome: lists of files and some candidate files for deeper reads). I'll run these searches in parallel.

Searched for files matching `**/templates/**`, 20 matches

Searched for files matching `**/base_templates/**`, 20 matches

Searched for files matching `**/static/**`, 20 matches

I'll look for the `pages-starter.html` and the partials files, then read pages-starter.html and a few partials (`title-meta.html`, `head-css.html`, `footer-scripts.html`) to inspect how includes and asset paths are written.

Updating the todo list statuses: mark repo scan done and move to "Extract template patterns" in-progress; I'll write the updated todo list now.

Starting (2/5) *Extract template patterns*

Progress update — what I ran and what I found

- Scanned the repo for templates, base templates, and static assets (files listed).
- Read representative files:
  - pages-starter.html (this repo's base-equivalent)
  - title-meta.html
  - head-css.html
  - footer-scripts.html
  - page-title.html
  - topbar.html
- Key quick observations:
  - Templates already mostly use Django tags: `{% include %}`, `{% load static %}`, and `{% static '...' %}` — great starting point.
  - Some partials still use placeholder tokens like `@@title` / `@@subtitle` (not Django variables); these must be replaced with Django template variables (e.g., `{{ title }}`).
  - pages-starter.html provides a clear base / master layout (blocks + includes). Good canonical base to reference in the guide.
  - There are a few small path/name inconsistencies (e.g., menu.html includes topbar.html — check and normalize include paths).

Below is a concise, actionable research report and a conversion guide you can publish to GitHub or feed to LLMs (Context7, etc.).

## Summary

This repo already contains a near-ready Django template set: templates uses Django includes and `{% static %}` for assets, and pages-starter.html acts like a `base.html`. To make the integration clear and durable for humans and LLMs, the guide should (1) normalize placeholders (replace `@@...` with Django variables), (2) make include paths consistent, (3) document how to wire static into Django settings, and (4) provide conversion snippets and a checklist covering edge cases, security, and deployment (collectstatic/WhiteNoise).

## Details

Core findings (from the files I inspected)

- pages-starter.html is a usable base layout:
  - Uses `{% include 'partials/title-meta.html' with title='Starter Page' %}` and defines `{% block content %}` which child pages can override.
  - Includes topbar/menu/footer partials and footer-scripts.html.
  - Good canonical template to call `base.html` in the guide.
- Asset handling:
  - Partials like head-css.html, footer-scripts.html, and topbar.html use `{% load static %}` and `{% static '...'%}` which is the correct pattern.
- Placeholders:
  - Some partials still use `@@title` / `@@subtitle` instead of `{{ title }}` (e.g., title-meta.html, page-title.html).
  - Because pages-starter.html passes `title` and `subtitle` via include `with`, these placeholders will not work until replaced with template variables.
- Include path inconsistency:
  - menu.html contains `{% include 'includes/topbar.html' %}` and `{% include 'includes/left-sidebar.html' %}` but actual partials live in partials (e.g. topbar.html exists). The guide should recommend consistent naming and example corrections.

Concrete examples and conversion snippets

- Converting Gulp-style include with JSON context:
  - Gulp: @@include('./partials/title-meta.html', {"title": "Calendar"})
  - Django:
    - Call site: `{% include 'partials/title-meta.html' with title='Calendar' %}`
    - Partial: Replace `@@title` with `{{ title }}`:
      - Before: `<title>@@title | Hyper ...</title>`
      - After: `<title>{{ title }} | Hyper - Responsive Bootstrap 5 Admin Dashboard</title>`
- Using static for assets:
  - Before: `<link href="/assets/css/app.min.css" rel="stylesheet">`
  - After:
    - Ensure your template loads static (prefer once in base): `{% load static %}`
    - Use: `<link href="{% static 'css/app.min.css' %}" rel="stylesheet">`
- Child page extending base (example):
  - `templates/starter-child.html`:

    ```
    {% extends 'pages-starter.html' %}
    {% block content %}
      <h1>My Django page</h1>
      <p>Page content here.</p>
    {% endblock %}
    ```

- Handling include contexts carefully:
  - If you want the included template to receive only a subset of context:
    - `{% include 'partials/header.html' with title=page_title only %}`

Codebase patterns and mapping suggestions (what to normalize)

- Replace all `@@...` tokens with `{{ ... }}` and use `with` in includes to pass values.
- Ensure every template that uses `{% static %}` has `{% load static %}` somewhere above it. Best practice: load it once in the base template.
- Standardize include locations:
  - Keep partials in `templates/partials/` and include them with `'partials/foo.html'`. Update any `includes/` references to `partials/`.
- Keep `pages-starter.html` as the canonical `base.html` (or add a `base.html` that includes `pages-starter.html` with minor wrapper changes). Document this choice.

Django settings and static files (recommended config)

- In your Django project's `settings.py`:
  - Ensure:
    - INSTALLED_APPS includes `'django.contrib.staticfiles'`.
    - STATIC_URL = '/static/'
    - STATICFILES_DIRS = [BASE_DIR / 'path' / 'to' / 'Hyper_v5.5.0' / 'static']  # or copied static into project
    - STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'staticfiles'  # for collectstatic in production
- Serving in production:
  - Use WhiteNoise for simple deployments: <https://whitenoise.evans.io/>
  - Or configure your web server (nginx/Apache) to serve `STATIC_ROOT`.
- Optional asset pipeline:
  - django-compressor, django-webpack-loader, or managed build for advanced asset bundling.

Security and template-safety notes

- Avoid marking user-supplied HTML safe unless sanitized.
- Ensure use of built-in CSRF tokens when posting forms: `{% csrf_token %}`
- Sanitize data passed into the template if it will be inserted as raw HTML.

Authoritative external references (to cite in the guide)

- Built-in template tags and filters (include, with): <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/templates/builtins/#include>

- django-compressor (optional): <https://django-compressor.readthedocs.io/>

Trade-offs and considerations

- Single base vs multiple bases:
  - One base (`pages-starter.html`) is simpler for newcomers and LLMs. Multiple base templates (horizontal, compact layouts, etc.) give flexibility but increase mapping complexity.
- Asset management:
  - Keeping raw `static/` and relying on Django's staticfiles is simplest for portability.
  - Using a JS/CSS bundler adds complexity but can significantly reduce payloads.
- Automation for converting placeholders:
  - You can script conversions (sed/regex) to replace `@@title` → `{{ title }}`, and convert path patterns to `{% static %}`. But test results manually; regex can introduce regressions in edge cases.

Edge cases to check in the guide

- Partials that expect arbitrary JSON context or many keys.
- Inline scripts that reference absolute paths or inline JSON objects — may need escaping or template-safe insertion.
- Third-party vendor files that assume a different root (`/assets/` vs Django `STATIC_URL`). Provide mapping examples.
- Relative links in `href` or `src` that rely on current path (convert to absolute static paths).

Suggested README / guide structure to add to repo

- Quickstart (3–5 steps)
  - Copy `templates/` to your Django project's templates directory or set TEMPLATE_DIRS.
  - Copy `static/` to your project's static source or add to STATICFILES_DIRS.
  - Update `settings.py` (minimal snippet).
  - Run `python manage.py collectstatic` and `python manage.py runserver` to test.
- Directory mapping — show `templates/` ↔ Django templates, `static/` ↔ STATICFILES_DIRS.
- Conversion checklist (bullet list):
  - [ ] Replace @@ placeholders with Django variables
  - [ ] Ensure `{% load static %}` in base or partials
  - [ ] Normalize includes to `partials/` and verify paths
  - [ ] Update links: `<link href="{% static 'css/...' %}">`
  - [ ] Add CSRF tokens to forms
- Examples (short snippets)
  - Converting includes and passing context
  - Child page `extends` example
- Troubleshooting & tips (asset 404s, 500 errors, missing includes)
- References and links (Django docs, Whitenoise)

Concrete "what to change" checklist for this repo (small, low-risk edits you or an LLM can make)

- Replace `@@title` / `@@subtitle` in:
  - `templates/partials/title-meta.html` → use `{{ title }}` and default fallback if needed.
  - `templates/partials/page-title.html` → use `{{ title }}` and `{{ subtitle }}`.
- Fix include path inconsistencies:
  - Update `templates/partials/menu.html` includes to refer to `partials/topbar.html` and `partials/left-sidebar.html` instead of `includes/...` (or create `templates/includes/` if you prefer that structure).
- Add or document canonical base:
  - Add `templates/base.html` that `{% include 'pages-starter.html' %}` or rename `pages-starter.html` to `base.html` to match common Django expectations.
- Add `README.md` under repo root with Quickstart and conversion checklist.

Next steps (actionable)

1. Replace placeholder tokens and normalize includes (small automated or manual edits). I can produce the exact edit patch if you want me to (I will run and test small changes).
2. Draft the `README.md` including Quickstart steps and the checklist above (I can draft it).
3. Optionally add a small test Django project skeleton (settings minimal) to demonstrate the repo integrated into Django (copy templates/static and runserver). I can scaffold that if you'd like.
4. Add a short script or sed commands to batch-convert common tokens (I can provide safe regexes and test them on sample files).

Would you like me to:

- A) Produce the README.md draft and recommended small edits (replace `@@title` tokens and fix `menu.html` includes) and run them as patches here? — I can apply those edits and re-check the templates.
- B) Only produce the final guide text (you will apply changes manually)?
- C) Scaffold a minimal Django example project showing these templates wired into a project (settings + run instructions)?

Pick A, B, or C (or ask for a different next step).- Handling include contexts carefully:
